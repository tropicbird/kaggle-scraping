The scraping.py is used to make [this kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hdsk38/comp-top-1000-data).

## UPDATE: 10th September, 2023

The scrping code has been separated into scraping_ranking.py and scraping_userdata.py. The scraping_ranking.py collects the data from the ranking page. The scraping_userdata.py collects users the data from the profile pages.
